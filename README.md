# OCCC Visitation Scheduling

OCCC currently utilizes multiple applications such as Excel and a third party software to manage the inmate visitation schedules.

OCCC needs a web-based system that will allow visitors to submit a visitation request from a computer, tablet, or phone and be able to receive an instant notification from OCCC if request is approved or declined.
